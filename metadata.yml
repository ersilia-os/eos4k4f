Title: Small molecule standardization
Description: The model outputs molecular representations at increasing levels of
  chemical abstraction, ranging from the full canonical structure to a 
  ChEMBL-standardized parent, a stereochemistry-free form, the core Murcko 
  scaffold, and a generic scaffold that removes atom-specific identities.
