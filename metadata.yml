Interpretation: 'The model outputs representations at multiple chemical abstraction levels: the canonical SMILES encodes the full molecule, the standardized SMILES corresponds to the ChEMBL-cleaned parent structure, the flattened SMILES removes stereochemistry, the Murcko scaffold captures the core ring–linker framework, and the generic scaffold further generalizes this framework by removing atom identities.'
